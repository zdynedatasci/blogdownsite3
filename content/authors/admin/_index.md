I am a Senior Research Analyst at the Oregon Department of Education where I am the lead research analyst supporting several essential education programs. My professional interests more broadly intersect data science with public management, public policy, and public health. I am an avid user of R, SQL, and Power BI and have experience with Python, SAS, and Tableau. I have an MBA, Graduate Certificate in Data Science, and BA in sociology all from Willamette University. Outside of work I enjoy reading philosophy, performing amateur improv comedy, and over analyzing baseball.
