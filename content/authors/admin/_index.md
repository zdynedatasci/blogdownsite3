I am a dedicated and creative May 2020 graduate of Willamette Universityâ€™s [MBA](https://willamette.edu/mba/) and [Graduate Certificate in Data Science](https://willamette.edu/mba/programs/data-science/index.html) programs. My experience and professional interests, beginning as a 15-year-old volunteer public health research assistant, intersect data science and quantitative research programming with public policy, public administration, and non-profit management. Since July, 2020 I have served as a Fiscal Grant Analyst for the Oregon Department of Education where I help ODE's internal grant managers with all things fiscal analysis, reporting, and accounting data management.
  

Through my experience and education, I have developed the following skills:

- Data Analysis Tools: R, Tableau, Excel, SQL, SAS, Python, SPSS, jamovi
- Statistics
- Financial and Managerial Accounting
- Project Management and Program Facilitation
- Tutoring and Tutorial Curation
- Public Speaking
