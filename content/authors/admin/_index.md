I am a Research Analyst for the Child Nutrition Programs at the Oregon Department of Education where I provide research, data analysis, and technical support on a range of nutrition related projects at ODE. My professional interests more broadly intersect data science with public management, public policy, and public health. I am an avid user of R, SQL, and Excel and have experience with Python, SAS, Tableau, and Oracle Hyperion. I have an MBA, Graduate Certificate in Data Science, and BA in sociology all from Willamette University. For fun I enjoy hiking around the PNW, reading about history, and watching baseball (go Dodgers!).
