I am a dedicated and creative May 2020 graduate of Willamette University’s MBA and Graduate Certificate in Data Science programs. My experience and professional interests, beginning as a 15-year-old volunteer public health research assistant, intersect data science and quantitative research programming with public policy, public administration, and non-profit management. After graduation, I plan to enter a career using data science principles to help solve public administration and policy problems.

After three years of non-profit program management and curriculum development, I’ve enjoyed applying my data science skills to my passion for community improvement through internships, consulting projects, and peer tutoring. During my data analytics internship focused at United Way of the Mid-Willamette Valley, I used Tableau and R for strategic planning, resource development, and fundraising analytics projects. I carried this experience of making end-user focused analytics products to my work at the Willamette MBA Community Grant Program, were I served as the Project Manager and Lead Financial Data Analyst. In addition to improving my leadership, program evaluation, and financial analysis skills, I built the program’s first SQL database to organize impact metrics on previously funded projects. I view data science as a useful set of problem-solving tools, and I take pride in being able to deploy them on teams with a range of technical familiarity.

Aside from data science and analytics, I consider communication and collaboration to be two of my greatest strengths. Additionally, from interviewing emergency room patients in Spanish at a county hospital, guiding litigants through filing paperwork for self-representation in civil court at a non-profit law firm, and co-administering a service-learning trip with five Japanese exchange students, I’ve had many opportunities to work with people from a range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds. My experience in data science, project management, and public health research, along with my academic background in mixed-methods social sciences, prepares me well to join a team solving management and policy problems.
