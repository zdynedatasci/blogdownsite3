<p>The lack of access to affordable housing is one of the biggest social issues throughout the United States. This is also true locally in Oregon, as the <a href="https://www.ocpp.org/2018/03/15/20180315-cost-burdened-housing/">Oregon Center for Public Policy</a> highlights. Both for-profit and non-profit organizations have become involved in building and managing affordable housing units, but there is clearly more work that needs to be done. During my time at <a href="https://www.unitedwaymwv.org/">United Way of the Mid-Willamette Valley</a>, the grantmaking organization had added a goal of becoming an affordable housing provider, or at minimum become a catalyst for other organizations to take on serious affordable housing efforts.</p>
<p>I was curious to see if I could find any data on affordable housing projects throughout Oregon. Where are they located? Where is the greatest need? How do the locations and needs overlap? Do the locations and need sufficiently overlap? Of course, the answer to the final question will not be “yes” until homelessness is eradicated. However, I wanted to see if I could get a glimpse at the current state of affairs.</p>
<div id="the-data-rsocrata-tidycensus-and-leaflet" class="section level2">
<h2>The Data: <em>RSocrata</em>, <em>tidycensus</em>, and <em>leaflet</em></h2>
<p>Fortunately, there is a plethora of R packages that make identifying, searching for, analyzing, and visualizing data to answer get at these questions possible! I will principally make use of RSocrata, tidycensus, and leaflet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>RSocrata</em> allows you to pull data from a socrata open data portal, which is how many entities publish open datasets, directly into R. The State of Oregon published a <a href="https://data.oregon.gov/Health-Human-Services/Affordable-Housing-Inventory/bq26-qyg4">dataset with a list of affordable housing properties throughout the State</a>, including street addresses and its management company.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>tidycensus</em> package allows you to pull data directly from the US Census Bureau into R. The Census’s American Community Survey (ACS) includes a question “Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income in the Past 12 Months” (identified as Table B25070). This question could be used to estimate how many people experience housing cost burden, which the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines as <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr_edge_featd_article_092214.html#:~:text=HUD%20defines%20cost%2Dburdened%20families,of%20one&#39;s%20income%20on%20rent.">spending at or more than 30% of household income on housing</a>. Other entities define this figure at 50%, but I will use the 30% threshold for this analysis. It’s important to remember that the ACS does not poll as many people as does the 10-year full census, which makes for higher margins of error in these estimates. With fewer people polled, the estimates have a higher chance of being incorrect. While they probably shouldn’t be used for publication in The Quarterly Journal of Economics, they can still be useful for our goal to get a sense of things.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>leaflet</em> package provides map-building capability in R. We can overlay these two data sources on a single map using leaflet to visualize percent of population who experiences a housing cost burden by county and the location of the listed affordable housing units.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I’ll use several other R packages to tie these unique features together, including <em>tidyverse</em>, <em>ggmap</em>, and <em>tigris</em> to name a few.</p>

<p>The ACS organizes each question table into sub-tables by bin (“Less than 10%”, “10%-14.9%”, etc). Using <em>tidycensus</em> to create a single dataframe of the table with each bin present requires pulling each sub-table separately, creating a sub-table identifier (which I called v2), and binding the rows together. Here is a glimpse of how the data looks after all of that.</p>

<p>The raw percent figures are pretty incredible to look at. Eight of Oregon’s 36 counties have an estimated housing-burdened population of over half of their total population! Many other counties’ estimates are just below 50% as well. Even Wheeler County’s estimated 20.5% seems very high.</p>
<p>With that, it is time to map!</p>
<p>The goal is to create a map of the percent housing burdened by county and add each of the affordable housing complexes listed by the State.</p>
<p>We first have to find the latitude and longitude coordinates (AKA geocode) the complex’s street addresses in order to plot them on a map.</p>

<p>The marker points for the housing complexes are clustered so that they are visable. The map would be very difficult to read without this option turned on.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Kind of a neat map. Somewhat unsprisingly, the amount of affordable housing complexes in each area is generally associated with population density. This also highlights the need for and logistical complexity of affordable housing in rural areas as well.</p>
